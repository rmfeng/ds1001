    "To tackle Target's problem of predicting pregnancy and delivery date based on shopping patterns, we can formalize the Problem, Data, Feature Extraction/Labeling, Modeling/Hypothesis Selection and Training sections of the problem by examining each part separately. In our terminology, this is a supervised learning problem. The write up will be made under the assumption that we are not sensitive to the considerations of Public Relations for the company and does not consider the sensitivity of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to target customer habits when they are the most open to change, we need to be able to predict these periods of time based on information we have on each customer. One such time in many peole's lives is the arrival of a new baby. However, since births records are public, there is a lot of competition amongst marketers immediately after birth. We would like to identify high probability pregnancies before the delivery date. The target variables in this case would be whether a person is pregnant and their delivery date.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As the article as indicated, Target collects a large amount of information on their customers and associates all of the data on each customer with a unique GuestID. This data includes the time, types and amount of product a customer is purchasing as well as the location/medium through which the customer enacted the transaction. It was detailed explicitly in the article, but it is also possible that the method of transaction (cash or credit or other) is record as well. Further, personal information about the guest, such as age, sex, income bracket could also be tracked.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Extraction / Labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "The features to consider is not only the products that the guest is purchasing, but also the timing and method that those products are being purchased. When available, we should also extract the personal information such as age, sex and income as features as they may have an impact on the target variables. For labeling, the baby-shower registry is a good starting point as we would know people who create a baby-shower registry is likely pregnant. We can also expand the labeled dataset by looking at the public birth records as indicated in the article. Finally we can further expand the dataset by exploring the products that confirm a baby such as diapers and formula. When considering the three different ways that data is labeled, we will need to becareful in dealing with potential biases between the labeling types - perhaps some methods are better at predicting true births than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modeling / Hypothesis Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are not only interested in the boolean target variable of whether a person is pregnant, but also interested in predicting the delivery date, not only do we have a classification problem, we also have a regression problem. However, it is possible to discretize the delivery date and reduce the full problem to just a classification problem. For example, we can discretize it to {'Not Pregnant', 'First Trimester', 'Second Trimester', 'Third Trimester'}. If we choose to approach it as a classification problem, we can try the decision tree approach covered in class, as well as differet linear or non-linear classifiers or neural networks. Alternatively, if we decide to keep the problem as a classification {'Pregnant', 'Not Pregnant'} in conjunction with a regression problem (how many months to delivery), we can explore first the classification techniques mentioned above for the classification problem and then various regression techniques such as ols, gls, logit and neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "This will depend on the model that we choose, some are closed form and others are iterative. In each case we will need to carefully split our data into Training, Validation and Test sets to train on the Training set, score using the validating set during training and then estimate real world performance using the Test set.\n",
