    "For this part we will be using the data file located in `\"data/advertising_events.csv\"`. This file consists of records that pertain to some online advertising events on a given day. There are 4 comma separated columns in this order: `userid`, `timestamp`, `domain`, and `action`. These fields are of type `int`, `int`, `string`, and `int` respectively. Answer the following questions using Linux/Unix bash commands. All questions can be answered in one line (sometimes, with pipes)! Some questions will have many possible solutions. Don't forget that in IPython notebooks you must prefix all bash commands with an exclamation point, i.e. `\"!command arguments\"`.\n",

You can also use ssh to use the actual bash shell on EC2 (see original directions) and then just paste your answers here. Recall that once you enter the \"!\" then filename completion should work.]"
